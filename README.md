# LogisticRegression

logistic regression is a type of regression analysis that models the probability of a binary outcome (yes/no, 0/1, true/false) based on one or more predictor variables. Unlike linear regression, which predicts a continuous numeric value, logistic regression predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class.
The "logistic" in logistic regression comes from the logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function. The sigmoid function takes any input and maps it to a value between 0 and 1. This characteristic makes it suitable for representing probabilities. In a logistic regression model, the goal is to find the best-fitting set of weights for the predictor variables, which maximizes the likelihood of the observed outcomes. This is typically done using optimization techniques like gradient descent.
